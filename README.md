Steps to find shortest path in the hierarchical road networks with time dependent travel times

Description about the variation in traffic on road networks, and the model, in general, is provided in the [hierarchical_tdsp.pdf](hierarchical_tdsp.pdf) file.

## Steps to implement 'Time dependent shortest path' algorithm in Python:
1) To get the network database from OpenStreetMap on your system, first install pgRouting. Instructions on how to install pgRouting is given on this link: https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/wiki/UsersWikiPostGIS22UbuntuPGSQL95Apt
